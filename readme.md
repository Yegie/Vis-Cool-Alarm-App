# Vi's Cool Alarm App

This is an alarm app I am making for personal use and intend to distribute via f-droid and the play store if I bring it into a usable state.

## Problem + Solution:
* I accumulate too many old inactive alarms
  * button to delete all inactive alarms
  * option to enable automatic deletion of long unused alarms
* I struggle to find specific alarms that are used every now and then
  * search bar for looking through alarm names
* I often have 3+ alarms that serve a similar purpose and should be enabled and disabled together
  * allow grouping of alarms
  * maybe allow easy creation of grouped alarms
* I want to pause alarms for a specific time and then have them turn back on
  * add an option to do that
  * add an option to pause all active alarms for a specific time
* I want to schedule alarm apps for a point in the future
  * add an option to schedule an alarm for a specific day
  * maybe add option to schedule for more than one specific day
* I don't trust various other alarm apps (especially ones that sync with google) to not harvest "anon" data about my schedule
  * make my own app that does not do any outbound calls
